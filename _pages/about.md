XVA World is a website covering all topics related to [XVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XVA), defined by Wikipedia as "a collective term referring to a number of different “valuation adjustments” that banks must make when assessing the value of derivative contracts that they have entered into". This includes notable the Credit Value Adjustment (CVA), first and also most popular value adjustment.

XVA World targets a wide audience: XVA traders, XVA risk managers, heads of trading desks, XVA quants, Transformation project managers and business analysts, IT business analysts, developers, and production support. It also aims to connect with people outside of banks such as solution providers (consultant, software vendors) and headhunters.

While XVA world was originally a one-man project, its purpose is not only to promote ideas and events but also individuals. Please [contact](/contact.html) me if you wish to submit an article, or an idea for one. You will be received with a warm welcome.

Finally, this website was developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the [Mundana theme](https://www.wowthemes.net/mundana-jekyll-theme/) by Sal from [@wowthemesnet](https://www.wowthemes.net/category/free-themes-templates/).
